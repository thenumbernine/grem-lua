Here's another attempt at solving the Einstein field equations on a grid
for certain electromagnetic stress-energy tensors
this time using discrete Helmholtz decomposition 
(note it is Helmholtz, not Hodge, as I'm using a flat space approximation, which is probably a bad idea)
I'm switching between inverse discrete laplace and inverse curl operators in hopes that the errors will converge out.
It's getting stuck, go figure.
It's all about the gauge.  Buchman has gauge cleaning in his NR tetrad formalism. Maybe I should look into that ...
