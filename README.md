Here's another attempt at solving the Einstein field equations on a grid
for certain electromagnetic stress-energy tensors
this time using discrete Hemholts decomposition 
(note Hemholtz, not Hodge, as I'm using a flat space approximation)
I'm switching between inverse discrete laplace and inverse curl operators in hopes that the errors will converge out.
It's getting stuck, go figure.
